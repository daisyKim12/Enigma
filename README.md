# Enigma Machine Program
This program simulates the operation of the Enigma machine using Python.

## Enigma Operation
The Enigma machine, used during World War II, had several key components:
- Rotors: The Enigma had three or four rotors, circular disks with electrical contacts. They were stacked in a specific order.
- Plugboard: Users could physically swap letters by plugging and unplugging cables on the plugboard for added encryption.
- Keyboard: Users typed plaintext messages on a keyboard.
- Electrical Connections: When a key was pressed, an electrical current passed through the plugboard, rotors, and reflector, creating a path.
- Rotor Movement: Rotors rotated with each keypress, changing the substitution cipher.
- Encryption: The electrical path through rotors and reflector determined letter substitutions, displayed on the lamp board as ciphertext.
- Transmission: Ciphertext was sent via telegraph or radio.
- Decryption: Recipients used Enigma machines configured the same way to decrypt messages.

## How to Run
1. When you run the program, a graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear.
2. Select the Rotors and the Reflector you want to use.
3. Enter a number in the "Today number" field. This number represents the initial position of each rotor.
4. Input the text you want to encrypt in the "Input" field.
5. Click the "Coding" button to perform the encryption.
6. The encrypted result will be displayed in the "Output" field.
